Can we beam power, in the form of light or microwaves, to
spacecraft, satellites, rovers, or factories?

In free space, how well can we keep a beam of microwaves
collimated? Or a laser. How well can we track a distant target?
Could we possibly beliver useful amounts of energy to a 
device hundreds of miles away? Thousands?

It would be a very big deal if you could power mining equipment
in this way, running at the bottoms of lunar craters in the 
permanently shaded areas and getting their power from solar
panels up in the sunlight.

It would also be a very big deal if satellites or tugs could 
accept beamed power over large distance, so that we could have 
a kind of virtual power company in space. It would be a great 
savings if we could centralize the production of power, so that 
every satellite or tug would not have to carry along its own 
little power plant.
