Spool out tiny wires radially around a spacecraft,
and charge them. The wires then interact with the
proton wind from the Sun, gaining momentum from it.

The wires are long, maybe 10 km, but very fine.
The fields that they generate are twenty meters
wide.

You might get acceleration of 1mm/sec^2, So you're 
traveling at 85 m/sec at the end of the first day, 
600 m/sec (0.37 miles per second), and 2.6 km/sec
(1.61 miles per second) at the end of the first
month.

The accelerating force falls off with distance 
from the Sun, but not nearly as fast as sunlight 
does. Almost as 1/r, rather than 1/(r^2).

No propellant!

One drawback is that there's no way to slow down 
again at the end of the trip except by whacking 
into something. 

Unless -- could magnetic breaking possibly work?
If your target were Neptune and you were doing 20
km/sec when you got there? 

Of course one way to slow down again would be to 
have another star at the end of your trip...
