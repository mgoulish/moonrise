Business: Peary Power and Light
---------------------------------------

The first electric utility on the Moon.

A single 100-ton Starship payload lands near northwest rim
of Peary Crater near lunar north pole. Using 100 kilowatts
of initial power from solar panels the telepresence machinery
uses nothing but sunlight, regolith, and materials carried
in the payload to grow into a 10 megawatt lunar power utility
within 3 years.

Power is transmitted to customers via microwave metamaterial
panels that allow precise tranmission over large distance.
These panels are 3D printed on Luna, of regoglass and 
terrestrial silver.
