The 'research' directory contains little research 
projects.  The first one, for example, is a study 
to answer the question: "What launch vehicles does
the human species have, what new ones are coming, 
and how much can they lift?"

That isn't a news event, and it doesn't fit into 
any of my other categories either.

Thus, the 'research' directory.
