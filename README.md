# Moonrise

*When I was ten years old I started keeping a scrapbook of all the newspaper articles I could find about Project Gemini. Later my growing collection of scrapbooks contained Project Apollo and they kept going right up to 14 December 1972 when Gene Cernan became the last American to leave the Moon.*

*Well, it's been a long time but now there is change in the winds of the Earth and in the winds of Outer Space. Pretty soon we'll be going back to that old Moon. This time, we're staying.*

*So! It looks like it's finally time for another scrapbook!*

*This is it.*
