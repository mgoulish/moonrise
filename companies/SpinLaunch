Use an immense centrifuge to gradually accelerate payloads 
to 1.4 miles per second then throw them into space.

Payloads up to ... 200 pounds.

On the positive side, they hope to be able to do 5 per day,
and the motive power is electricity from the grid, so this
could be the least expensive launch technology per pound by far.

But ... your payload has to endure 10,000 Gs of acceleration.
And entering the thick air of the lower atmosphere at 1.4
miles per second?

This all seems very limiting.

Although ... if you were launching raw materials ... and doing
it from a place that doesn't have any atmosphere... that might 
be very interesting indeed. And much easier to build than a 
long linear motor.

Let's see if they can demonstrate it.
