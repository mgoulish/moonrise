VASIMIR -- Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket

Ionize the reaction mass (argon, xenon, or hydrogen), 
heat the plams with techniques similar to some used in 
fusion research, use magnetic nozzle to accelerate plasma
to 112,000 mph.

VASIMIR can vary its thrust and specific impulse more than 
other ion engines. It does non-contact heating of the plasma,
and it can use all the power you can supply.

Seems like a good way to use a megawatt-class nuke.

They have demonstrated a 200 KW prototype on Earth.

VASIMIR is probably the best tech we have for fast travel 
to Mars.
