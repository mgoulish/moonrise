The Main Idea
{
  To 'get to space' many companies only need cubesats -- 
  small payloads made of 4x4x4 inch 'units' -- but they 
  always have to wait around for a large launch company 
  to let them hitch a ride, and then they have to accept
  whatever orbit they can get.

  Astra wants to make launches easier, more frequent,
  and more customizable for this market.

  As of 1 Jan 2021, about 1500 cubesats have been launched.
}


Will be first publicly-traded launch company.


Small-launch specialist, 40-foot rocket plans to deliver
first commerical payload summer, 2021.

Rockets have 100 kilogram payload to LEO (Low Earth Orbit).


Maximum cubesat deployer for which they are now taking 
reservations: 12U (mass of 24 kg, size of 23 cm x 24 cm x 36 cm)
