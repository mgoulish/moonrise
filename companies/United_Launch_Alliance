Vulcan Centaur disposable rockets.
Two-stage, with 2, 4, or 6 small solid rockets
added on to first stage.

They say they are revolutioninzing the launch
business, but it's difficult to understand how,
with all-disposable launch vehicle.

Cost for a basic mission putting 18,800 kg into
LEO is $3800/kg. That's about 40% more per kg 
than a Falcon-9 launch.  

So....I'm not seeing how that's revolutionary.


I should point out, however, that ULA is the
first company on the planet to have a "Rocket 
Builder" page on their website, where you can 
configure the launch you want. (I hope I 
remembered to hit 'cancel'!)
