Trend : Launch Costs
------------------------------------------------------

In the 36 years from the first Space Shuttle flight
to the year 2016, launch costs per kilogram to Low
Earth Orbit fell by a factor of 15. In the next four
years they fell by a further factor of 6. 

This has brought launch costs into a domain where 
exponentially more business models for using near-Earth
space have suddenly become viable, and many 
longer-distance prospects have suddenly become possible.

It is hard to believe Elon Musk's recent statement that 
Starship costs may fall to as low as $2 million per
launch but, if so, that would represent a further cost
reduction of a factor of 50.

Even a further factor of 5 would bring costs below $200
per kilogram. 


Analysis
--------------------

We are very close to, or have already crossed into, a
cost domain where we are seeing a 'gold rush' stampede
into a new territory. In that environment there may be
many simultaneous competing economic forces, and it will
probably be difficult to predict which will fail, and
which will have low, high, or explosive growth rates.

Overall, this looks like a **very good time indeed** to 
be training to be able to contribute in any way to any 
aspect of space exploration and commercialization.
