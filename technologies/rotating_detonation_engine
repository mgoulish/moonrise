A detonation is a chemical reaction that moves faster
than the speed of sound in its medium. It is fundamentally
different than subsonic reactions.

All current rocket engines use subsonic combustion, also
called 'deflagration'. (Well ... there may be some that use
non-combustion reactions. I'm not sure.) A rocket engine 
that could use detonation of its propellant could get as 
much as 1/3 again more propulsion from the same amount of 
fuel.

But how do you get a supersonic detonation to stay inside a
little rocket engine??

You make it to spin round and round.

One way to do it is to have two consentric metal cylinders 
with a small gap between them. Into that gap you inject the
propellant, and set it off. You get one or more -- or maybe
two or more -- detonation shockwaves that race round and 
round the inter-cylinder gap.

It is not easy to get this to work. But a potential 25% 
improvement in fuel-efficiency is worth a very great deal 
indeed,

There is currently a team at the University of Central 
Florida that has made it work well enough to get a 
functioning testbed on which they can move and change 
things and experiment.

There may have been various teams that managed to experiment
with this in the past, but I doubt they had anything like 
the UCF level of configurability and measureability.

This could be a very big deal.

Go, UCF Knights!
Reach for the Stars.
