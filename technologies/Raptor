SpaceX's Raptors are the best chemical rocket engines
that have ever been made.

It's a methane-oxygen engine, which means you might be
able to make fuel for it on Mars ...

Hold on, I typed that wrong. What I meant to say was:
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE FUEL FOR IT ON MARS.

*And* it's a staged-combustion engine which means that 
both the methane and the oxygen go through little pre-
burner chambers before they come to the main combustion
chamber, so they arrive hot which apparently helps a lot.

People have tried to make such an engine before, but
nobody before SpaceX has ever actually flown one.
SpaceX, so far, has done a couple of short hop tests 
and it didn't blow up.

They hope to achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of 200-to-1.

Oops. I meant:

    !!!  T W O    H U N D R E D    T O    O N E  !!!

... which would be the best ever achieved in this part
    of the galaxy.
