Dust! Very fine particles of regolith stick to everything, 
get tracked inside, get in people's lungs, mess up 
machines. The Apollo astronauts had issues with dust in the 
brief time they stayed. If we start having long-term visits
and, eventually, a permanent presence on the Moon, we are 
going to have to get good at dealing with moondust.

Also, one of the main things we need to do if we are going
to establish a permanent lunar presence is to land spacecraft
on it. That means rockets, and that means dust is going to 
blow around. And there's no air to stop it! How *far* will 
that dust blow? Will it coat every person, dome, and machine 
in the vicinity? And ... how *large* is that vicinity?

And how hard will that blowing dust strike things? Hard
enough to sand-blast them? Keep those rockets away from my
telescopes!

I think we're going to need dust-free landing pads.

Will we someday see lunar tractors with rotating brushes 
on the front, cleaning off landing pads?
