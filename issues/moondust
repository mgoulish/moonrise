Dust! Very fine particles of regolith stick to everything, 
get tracked inside, get in people's lungs, mess up 
machines. The Apollo astronauts had issues with dust in the 
brief time they stayed. If we start having long-term visits
and, eventually, a permanent presence on the Moon, we are 
going to have to get good at dealing with moondust.
