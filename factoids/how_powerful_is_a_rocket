When we see a Falcon 9 launch -- how much energy is being
expended by that big first stage? And how fast?

Falcon 9 Full-Thrust first stage burns for 162 seconds.
It starts out with 411,000 kg of RP-1 kerosene, and I 
will assume that it uses 95% of that fuel during ascent.
These numbers are not made public by SpaceX, but Spaceflight101
says that the propellent mass number comes from the FAA.
The 95% figure is an educated guess.

So that is 411000 * 0.95 == 390450 kg of RP-1 used.
How much energy is that per kg?  43 MegaJoules.
So we are expending 390450 * 43e6 == 16789350e6 Joules.

A Joule is a watt-second, so we have 16789350000000 
Watt-seconds expended in 162 seconds.
      
      16789350000000 Watt-seconds / 162 seconds == 

         103637962963 Watts     == 
         103637963    kiloWatts ==
         103638       megaWatts ==
         104          gigaWatts

Holy yikes. 

In the two minutes and forty-two seconds of its fiery ascent, 
Falcon 9 is putting out one-tenth as much power as the entire 
electrical generating capacity of the United States.

I wonder what the corresponding number for Starship will be?!
